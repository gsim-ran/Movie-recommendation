# Movie-recommendation System
This project uses the available dataset to recommend movies based on the user preference.
In this project i have loaded the movie dataset having genre column.
Then i created text-based feature for each movie using TF-IDF Vectorization.
Then i computed cosine similarity between the user input movie with other movies and recommended similar movies after asking the user for input movie.
